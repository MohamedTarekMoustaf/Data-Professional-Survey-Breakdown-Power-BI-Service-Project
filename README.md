This Power BI report was automatically created on the Power BI Service (Software as a service: Saas). It provides an interactive analysis of survey responses collected from data professionals, focusing on time spent, participation trends, and industry distribution over time.

The dashboard in the following image was an automatically created report using Power BI Service through the following steps:
1. Data Transformation and Dashboard Building using Power BI Desktop.
2. Report "Final_Project.pbix" Publishing from Power BI Desktop to "My workspace" in Power BI Service. (**See the lineage view of the published semantic model with the associated reports**)
